CircadianAdvancedStats - the precursor.  Takes a subset of circadian-related data I know I have full data for (no missing values), and throw every technique at it
StatsExplorationLEPVsShower - exploring a specific tricky relationship I know exists in a 2D dataset, and seeing what techniques pick it up
StatsExplorationTwoVariables - a generalisation of StatsExplorationLEPVsShower that explores every useful technique in 2D space
StatsExplorationAllFeatures - a generalisation of CircadianAdvancedStats to try and work with all my features
DayDataPrep - prepping the tabular day data
StatsExplorationClustering - focussed on refining clustering, as I'll need to do that a lot
