It's pretty effective and I'm asleep soon.  Maybe 2310.\\nThere was a Home Assistant bug and I didn't capture all the night wakings I think.  Sure I recall clicking it a bit more.

       "  'note': \"Well, horrible night.\\n\\nSettling took forever, despite being on book most of it . Didn't feel too over stimulated but probably was based on day. Tried to take 7.5mg ritalin but was probably more like 9 as 2nd two were quite large. So absolutely says when under 10mg can be too much.\\n\\nAnimals were a big problem. (Charlie away again). Woke at 4 but don't recall if that was puppy needing to go out and/or thinking of something at work. (Because I broke a rule of not checking slack for new stuff during last hours of work, because I was overstimulated). Puppy definitely needed to go out at 5.50 and wanted up about 8. And cat spent night with me. Doesn't matter how big a bed we got - she would want to take too much and be too close to my warmth, for me to sleep comfortably through it.\\nDon't feel I got much sleep after 4, whatever the watch shows. Was trying to sleep, but failed. \",\n",
