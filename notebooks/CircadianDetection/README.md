Spun off from FinalWakeEDA, as I realise that what I'm trying to do there really, is detect circadian rhythm patterns throughout night.

CircadianEDA: now about investigating CR patterns over all days.
CircadianEDA2: to investigate stuff discovered during day-to-day walkthrough of circadian data.  Because I can't face getting everything working in CircadianEDA2 right now.
CircadianPointFinding: moved all the LEP etc. finding stuff from CircadianEDA to here, as a) it's not working well and b) I'm not using it.
